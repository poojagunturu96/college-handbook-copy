## Start developing

Clone the repo and install node dependencies:

```

```

To serve the production build of the site for testing prior to deployment:

## Contributing to the project 

Look at CONTRIBUTING.md for instructions on how to add new pages to the handbook. 

## Project Setup
This project uses [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/front-end-framework/) and [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/). The built assets are served as an Azure site at [handbook.middlebury.edu](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/). 

The built assets are also served through Netlify at [college-handbook.netlify.app](https://college-handbook.netlify.app), in order to take advantage of Netlify's built-in authentication service called [Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/manage/security/secure-access-to-sites/identity/overview/). It allows for easy management of users for this application.
To manage the college handbook site in Netlify go to app.netlify.com and login using the webaster@middlebury.edu account.

The CMS can be accessed at [college-handbook.netlify.app/admin](https://college-handbook.netlify.app/admin/).
